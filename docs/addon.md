# Rafay AddOn for EKS Blueprints for CDK Reference Architecture

This Addon deploys Rafayâ€™s Kubernetes Operations Platform (KOP) for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) management and operations. With KOP, your platform and site-reliability engineering (SRE) teams can deploy, operate, and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes clusters and containerized applications in both AWS Cloud and on-premises environments.

With the Rafay Kubernetes Operations Platform, enterprises use a single operations platform to manage the lifecycle of Amazon EKS clusters and containerized applications. You can speed up the deployment of new applications to production, reduce application downtimes, and reduce security and compliance risks associated with your infrastructure.

Rafay automates the deployment of containerized applications and enables access to Kubernetes clusters through a zero-trust connectivity model. A unified dashboard provides enterprise-grade capabilities, such as monitoring across AWS Regions, role-based access control, and governance.
